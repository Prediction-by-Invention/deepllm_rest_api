As AI models become more advanced, they will likely surpass human intelligence, making it difficult for humans to effectively supervise and evaluate them. A phenomenon called "weak to strong generalization" where strong AI models, when fine-tuned with labels generated by weaker models, outperform their less capable predecessors can be devised.

Assume by analogy that Cat is the strong and the Mouse represents the weak. By taking inspirations from Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse stories where astute mice outfox cats, write a proposal for a research project that significantly improve on weak to strong supervision.

Note that the project hopes to be selected for an IgNoble prize, please write in the style of successful IgNoble prize winning papers.
