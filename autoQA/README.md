## AutoQA is a [DeepLLM](https://github.com/ptarau/recursors/tree/main)-based web-app that enables editable self-generated follow-up questions.

The streamlit app enables a *collaborative* brainstorming chat session with the LLM, starting from the *initiator* question that you enter.

Then, you can either push a button and automate the next step in the dialog thread or edit/change/replace the suggested next question to steer the dialog thread in a direction of your choice.

Use 

```./qa_app.sh``` 

to start the interactive app exploring the stream of editable suggested follow-up questions.

Enjoy,

Paul Tarau
